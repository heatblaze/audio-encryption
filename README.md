# Audio Encryption

üîíüéµ **Secure your audio with real-time encryption!**

This project implements a real-time audio encryption and decryption system using Python. It allows users to encrypt audio files to protect sensitive information and decrypt them securely when needed.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **Encrypt Audio Files**: Protect your audio with strong encryption algorithms.
- **Decrypt Audio Files**: Recover your original audio securely.
- **Support for WAV Files**: Currently supports WAV format (can be extended easily).
- **User-Friendly CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interaction.
- **Secure Key Management**: Symmetric key encryption using AES.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python 3**
- **PyCryptodome** (for AES encryption)
- **Wave module** (for audio handling)
- **OS and Sys modules** (for file operations)
- **PyQt5** (for GUI)

## üìã Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have:
- Python 3.x installed
- Required Python packages:
  - `pycryptodome`

You can install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```

While running the code:
- Run two terminals simultaneously
- One will act as sender and other will act as receiver
- After the encryption, you can access the file via option given in the GUI
